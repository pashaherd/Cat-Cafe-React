## Project Analysis

This Cat Cafe Project is a great way to familiarize yourself with the react fundamentals. 
Starting with the BrowserRouter package in react, its a very efficient way of implementing routes in an app. This Comes In Handy especially when integrating with node js this process is seamless. Part of what makes react so great is the extensive libraries such as "react-router-dom" that make processes 10x simplier. 

A Challenge that arose during this project was fully understanding useState hook. useState works by comparing the virtual dom and the actual dom to check if the application state has changed. if so, the component & all child components will be rerendered. this process is asynchronous and can cause some funky behaviour if not understood correctly. 

Reacts best perk in my opinion is rhe flexibiliy of the jsx syntax. This really makes the differnece when u want to render certain elements or content under certian conditions. 

To Conclude, this react project was fun & very insightful when it comes to understanding the react under the hood. 


## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
